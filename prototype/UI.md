# UI Prototype

Generate **several structurally different UI variations** on a single route, switchable from a floating bottom bar. The user compares them in app context and evaluates what to keep. Follow [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for provisional findings, retained local evidence, explicit adoption, and agreed cleanup.

If the question is about logic/state rather than what something looks like — wrong branch. Use [LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md).

## When this is the right shape

- "What should this page look like?"
- "I want to see a few options for this dashboard before committing."
- "Try a different layout for the settings screen."
- Any time the user would otherwise spend a day picking between three vague mockups in their head.

## Two sub-shapes — strongly prefer sub-shape A

A UI prototype is much easier to judge when it's **butting up against the rest of the app** — real header, real sidebar, real data, real density. A throwaway route on its own is a vacuum: every variant looks fine in isolation. Default to sub-shape A whenever there's a plausible existing page to host the variants. Only reach for sub-shape B if the prototype genuinely has no nearby home.

### Sub-shape A — adjustment to an existing page (preferred)

The route already exists. Variants are rendered **on the same route**, selected by a `?variant=` URL search param inside the project's development/prototype gate. Preserve the existing surrounding layout, params, auth, and appropriate read-only data context; stub mutation paths. Without an active prototype gate, keep the normal page rendering regardless of the query parameter. This is the default when the page provides the right context.

If the prototype is for something that doesn't yet have a page but _would naturally live inside one_ (a new section of the dashboard, a new card on the settings screen, a new step in an existing flow) — that's still sub-shape A. Mount the variants inside the host page.

### Sub-shape B — a new page (last resort)

Only use this when the thing being prototyped genuinely has no existing page to live inside — e.g. an entirely new top-level surface, or a flow that can't be embedded anywhere sensible.

Create a **throwaway route** following whatever routing convention the project already uses — don't invent a new top-level structure. Name it so it's obviously a prototype (e.g. include the word `prototype` in the path or filename). Same `?variant=` pattern.

Before committing to sub-shape B, sanity-check: is there really no existing page this could be embedded in? An empty route hides design problems that a populated one would expose.

In both sub-shapes the floating bottom bar is identical.

## Process

### 1. State the question and pick N

Default to **3 variants**. More than 5 stops being radically different and starts being noise — cap there.

Write down the plan in one line, in the prototype's location or a top-of-file comment:

> "Three variants of the settings page, switchable via `?variant=`, on the existing `/settings` route."

This works whether the user is here to push back or not.

### 2. Generate radically different variants

Draft each variant. Hold each one to:

- The page's purpose and the data it has access to.
- The project's component library / styling system (TailwindCSS, shadcn, MUI, plain CSS, whatever).
- A clear exported component name, e.g. `VariantA`, `VariantB`, `VariantC`.

Variants must be **structurally different** — different layout, different information hierarchy, different primary affordance, not just different colours. Three slightly-tweaked card grids isn't a UI prototype, it's wallpaper. If two drafts come out too similar, redo one with explicit "do not use a card grid" guidance.

### 3. Wire them together

Create a single switcher component on the route:

```tsx
// pseudo-code — adapt to the project's framework
// Evaluate the repository's supported prototype gate before selection.
if (!prototypeEnabled) return <NormalPage {...data} />;
const variant = searchParams.get("variant") ?? "A";
return (
  <>
    {variant === "A" && <VariantA {...data} />}
    {variant === "B" && <VariantB {...data} />}
    {variant === "C" && <VariantC {...data} />}
    <PrototypeSwitcher variants={["A", "B", "C"]} current={variant} />
  </>
);
```

For sub-shape A (existing page): preserve appropriate read-only data and app context; only the rendered subtree changes per variant. Keep mutation handlers stubbed. Apply the prototype gate before variant selection so production cannot select a prototype through a query parameter.

For sub-shape B (new page): the throwaway route, named according to repository conventions, mounts the same switcher. Exclude the route from production using the project's supported mechanism.

### 4. Build the floating switcher

A small fixed-position bar at the bottom-centre of the screen with three pieces:

- **Left arrow** — cycles to the previous variant (wraps around).
- **Variant label** — shows the current variant key and, if the variant exports a name, that name too. e.g. `B — Sidebar layout`.
- **Right arrow** — cycles forward (wraps around).

Behaviour:

- Clicking an arrow updates the URL search param using the project's existing routing API so the selected variant remains reload-stable. Check current framework documentation if changing routing behavior or using unfamiliar APIs. A local URL does not authorize publication.
- Keyboard: `←` and `→` arrow keys also cycle. Don't intercept arrow keys when an `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `[contenteditable]` is focused.
- Visually distinct from the page (e.g. high-contrast pill, subtle shadow) so it's obviously not part of the design being evaluated.
- Exclude the switcher, variant selection, and prototype variants from production using the repository's supported development/prototype gate. Do not hide only the bar while leaving prototype rendering selectable. Inspect the production path and report verification gaps.

Put the switcher in a single shared component so both sub-shapes can reuse it. Locate it wherever shared UI lives in the project.

### 5. Hand it over

Surface the URL (and the `?variant=` keys). The user will flip through whenever they get to it. The interesting feedback is usually **"I want the header from B with the sidebar from C"** — that's the actual design they want.

### 6. Capture the evaluated answer and retain evidence

Until the user evaluates the variants, record findings as provisional. Once evaluated, record the chosen direction and why in the PRD or existing session document, along with the question, limitations, and local artifact pointer. Preserve representative screenshots or other inspectable evidence of the compared alternatives before agreed cleanup. Follow [SKILL.md](SKILL.md); do not automatically commit, publish, delete evidence, or promote a winner.

If production adoption is requested, implement the chosen direction with normal tests, error handling, and integration verification. Remove exploration scaffolding from production paths. Delete retained runnable artifacts only after user review and agreement on cleanup, preserving the agreed evidence and updating links.

Retained local evidence should stay clearly labeled; it must not become an active production route or feature.

## Anti-patterns

- **Variants that differ only in colour or copy.** That's a tweak, not a prototype. Real variants disagree about structure.
- **Sharing too much code between variants.** A shared `<Header>` is fine; a shared `<Layout>` defeats the point. Each variant should be free to throw out the layout.
- **Wiring variants to real mutations.** Read-only prototypes are fine. If a variant needs to mutate, point it at a stub — the question is "what should this look like", not "does the backend work".
- **Promoting the prototype directly to production.** The variant code was written under prototype constraints (no tests, minimal error handling). Rewrite it properly when you fold it in.
